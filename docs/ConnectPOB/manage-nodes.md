# Manage Nodes

NodeAdmin show all nodes in a table and where they are placed on the map. This is also where it is possible to set up a node as Muster station and Muster station with muster box

## Map (GA - General Arrangement)

This map show the vessel and all its rooms. It is possible to place nodes from the [node list](#node-list) in the map. The placement in the map should represent the physical placement onboard the vessel.
It is possible to select how to view the node links in the map.

### Showing node parent

Shows a line from the selected node to its parent. It will also show the path if there is grand parents, great grand parents etc. until it gets to the root node which is communicating with the gateway. It is a good tool to see what nodes are depending on others to be able to perform their task.

<div class="img-container">
<img src="./node-admin-images/map-images/map-parents.png" alt="Showing node with node links to neighbouring nodes and signal strength"/>
</div>

### Showing node children

Shows a line to the children of the node. A node can have several children.

<div class="img-container">
<img src="./node-admin-images/map-images/map-children.png" alt="Showing node with node links to children"/>
</div>

### Showing node neighbours

Shows a line to the 10 neighbours with best signal of a node and the signal strength to each node. These nodes are the possible parents or children of the selected node.

</div>

## Node list

Shows all nodes placed in map, and not placed in map.

</div>

### Components in the node list

<br/>

#### OWC Status

Press the icon to request a new update of the nodes. If a configuration is not as you expect, this can be a good first step to see if the configuration will update

<img src="./node-admin-images/owc-status.png" alt="OWC status refresh" class="component-image"/>

#### Table headers

Headings for the different sections showing the number of nodes in each section.

<img src="./node-admin-images/nodes-not-in-map.png" alt="Nodes not placed in map" class="component-image"/>
</div>

#### Node list table header

Sub header where it is possible to sort items by name, time or signal strength in Ascending or Descending order.

|     C     | Sort by the nodes by signal strength <br><br> Meaning how strong the signal is between the node and its parent node | ![Signal strength icon](../icons/antenna-4.svg) |

#### Node list table item

This is a node that has been added to the system. This node can be configured and placed in the map to display its position on the vessel.

## Node manager

Opened by pressing the "Manage" button in the [Node List Table Item Details ( I )](#node-list-table-item-details). This is where a user can place a node in the map, change location of a placed node, set a node as muster station with or without a muster box, set retention and/or sensitivity level for muster station and muster box and lastly set a node as a Alarm node.
