# Handling of information

The ConnectPOB dashboard provides the opportunity
to connect wearables to persons onboard, as well
as getting this information from various crewing
systems. Only authenticated users with required roles
have access to this information. The company
responsible for the acquisition of ConnectPoB will also
designate users for the different security levels. All
data in the system is secured by ScanReach.

ConnectPOB is delivered as a “plug and play” solution
and can be easily installed by the crew during normal
operation. The system is wireless, with no cabling
required between sensors. It also features battery
backup for continuous real- time data flow during
potential vessel power blackouts.

  mentioned earlier.
